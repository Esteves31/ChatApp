# ChatApp

This project was created to learn about how to create a Client/Server chat application. 
In this code, I'm using Qt Framework based on TCP/IP protocol whit the libraries like
QTcpServer, QTcpSocket. Honorable mention for [vRFEducation](https://www.youtube.com/@vrfEducationEnglish),
based on his video lesson I'm learning and developing this project, which can be found
on his youtube playlist about Network Programming with Qt.
